# Implementation-of-Honeypot-For-server-security

Project Honey Pot is a distributed system that allows website administrators to track, analyze, and mitigate malicious activity such as spam, email harvesting, and automated attacks on their servers. It functions as a network of honeypots—decoy servers or web pages—that attract and collect data about malicious visitors. This data includes IP addresses, user agent strings, referrer information, and other metadata that can help identify and block malicious actors.

Here's a comprehensive description of Project Honey Pot and its integration with Yagmail, a Python library for sending emails:

**Project HoneyPot**:

Project HoneyPot operates on the principle of deception. It sets up traps across the web in the form of honeypots—essentially fake targets designed to attract malicious activity. These honeypots can be email addresses hidden within web pages, fake web forms, or entire dummy websites. When a malicious bot or user interacts with these honeypots, Project Honey Pot records the interaction details, including the IP address of the attacker, the time and date of the interaction, the type of activity, and other relevant information.

This collected data is invaluable for identifying patterns of malicious behavior, such as spamming, scraping, or attempting unauthorized access. Website administrators can use this data to enhance their server security by implementing measures to block or filter out malicious traffic. Project Honey Pot provides various tools and services to assist administrators in analyzing and responding to threats effectively.

**Integration with Yagmail**:

Yagmail is a Python library that simplifies the process of sending emails using Gmail accounts. It provides a straightforward interface for composing and sending emails programmatically, making it a convenient tool for automated email notifications and alerts.

Integrating Project HoneyPot with Yagmail allows server administrators to receive real-time notifications about malicious activity detected by the honeypot system. Here's how the integration can work:

1. **Detection of Malicious Activity**: When Project Honey Pot detects suspicious activity on the server, such as an attempt to access a honeypot email address or submit a fake form, it triggers an event.

2. **Generation of Notification**: A script or application running on the server is programmed to respond to these events. Upon detection, it generates an email notification containing relevant details about the detected activity, such as the IP address of the attacker and the type of attack.

3. **Sending Email via Yagmail**: The script utilizes the Yagmail library to compose and send an email using a designated Gmail account. The email contains the pertinent information about the detected malicious activity, formatted for easy interpretation by the recipient.

4. **Delivery to Insider**: The email is sent directly to the designated recipient or group of recipients, such as the server administrator or security team responsible for monitoring and mitigating threats. Insider, in this context, refers to the individuals within the organization who have the authority and responsibility to address security incidents promptly.

By integrating Project Honey Pot with Yagmail, server administrators can receive immediate notifications about potential security threats, enabling them to take timely action to protect their servers and mitigate risks posed by malicious actors. This proactive approach to server security helps maintain the integrity and availability of online services while safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access and exploitation.
